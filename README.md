# Visualize gender gaps in different majors

This was a guided project on Dataquest, where we compared the gender gap in college degrees. To do that, we separated the degrees into three categories: STEM, Lib Arts and Others.

The main focus on this was on visualisation, and to ensure the best data-ink ratio.
